write
a main function accept your wrie request
it calculates the hash function of write request, eg {user: "data"}
    3%10 -> 3
if a node exist for the corresposing id, add the user to that node
if a node does not exist, create the node and add to that node

read
a main function accept read request
calculate hash of read request
if node exist for the corresponding id, read that node
it does not, say sorry

{1: set({1: ["data1", "data2"], 2: ["data1", "data2"]})}

{1:"datacjehfoefaefvavhsojsivgifji"}

hash the key
store the key in server corresponding to that hash
now if server goes down (i will randomly assign a server healthcheck endpoint as ERROR)
